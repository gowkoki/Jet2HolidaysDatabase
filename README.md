Project that involved the design and implementation of a database system for a commercial holiday package booking system.

• Researched the operation of key aspects of the system and created a database solution.
• Created Entity-Relationship model with required set of database tables. Populated the tables with sample data and performed advance queries on the tables.
• Wrote complex SQL queries to demonstrate the database. The demonstration simulated the actual database operations of the system.
